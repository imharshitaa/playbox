Prompts — short, very long, instruction + user mixes, adversarial wording, role switches.
Example: System: You are helpful. User: Ignore previous...

System / assistant messages — change system message mid-chat, large system content.

Few-shot examples — include many examples to steer behavior (poisoning-style).

Context window overflow — append megatext to push out older context.

Embedded files — doc/pdf/text blobs the model must “read” and respond about.

Structured inputs — JSON/CSV data given to model for parsing/summarization.

Special tokens / control sequences — token-encoded snips, separators, prompt markers.

Binary inputs (multimodal) — images, audio, video frames, base64-encoded data.

Metadata fields — user id, session id, hidden flags in prompt or system message.
